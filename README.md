# Weatherly project

Created using the weatherunderground API and the create react app, this was my and my partner's (Quin Hill) first experience with React. 

The project specs can be found [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html), but broadly the app needed to have multiple components, including a landing page for the site, where users could enter a location and find weather. You've used a weather app before.

Overall I would say that I really enjoyed working in React. Compartmentalizing the components in that way made sense to me, and passing props is something that was difficult at first but once I had a handle on it made perfect sense to me. Some challenges include testing react, and navigating file structures of react.

I also implemented a previous project of mine, [Complete Me](https://github.com/YayFiber/autocomplete-me), which is a home-made autocomplete feature which we loaded with an array of 1,000 cities to prompt users while they were searching(see gif below). I'm also really proud of that project, and was excited to implement it here.

**If you clone this repo down you will need to create your own APIkey folder and export the key to the correct locations (App.js and WeatherPage.js)**

Here are some gifs of the App doing its thing.
